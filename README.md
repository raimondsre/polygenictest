## Introduction

**raimondsre/polygenictest** is a bioinformatics pipeline that calculates individual polygenic score percentile in the population.

<!-- TODO nf-core:
   Complete this sentence with a 2-3 sentence summary of what types of data the pipeline ingests, a brief overview of the
   major pipeline sections and the types of output it produces. You're giving an overview to someone new
-->

<!-- TODO nf-core: Include a figure that guides the user through the major workflow steps. Many nf-core
<!-- TODO nf-core: Fill in short bullet-pointed list of the default steps in the pipeline -->

1. Read genome file
2. Apply quality control
3. Impute missing genotypes
4. Calculate polygenic risk score

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> If you are new to Nextflow, please refer to [this page](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/index.html).

<!-- TODO nf-core: Describe the minimum required steps to execute the pipeline, e.g. how to prepare samplesheets.
     Explain what rows and columns represent. For instance (please edit as appropriate):

First, prepare a samplesheet with your input data that looks as follows:

`samplesheet.csv`:

```csv
sample,fastq_1,fastq_2
CONTROL_REP1,AEG588A1_S1_L002_R1_001.fastq.gz,AEG588A1_S1_L002_R2_001.fastq.gz
```

Each row represents a fastq file (single-end) or a pair of fastq files (paired end).

-->

Now, you can run the pipeline using:

<!-- TODO nf-core: update the following command to include all required parameters for a minimal example -->

```bash
nextflow run raimondsre/polygenictest \
   -profile <docker/singularity/.../institute> \
   --input samplesheet.csv \
   --outdir <OUTDIR>
```

> [!WARNING]
> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_;
